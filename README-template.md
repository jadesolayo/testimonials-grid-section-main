### What I learned

- While working on this project, I had a better understanding on how to use  CSS grid and how to position elements with the grid column and row property.

- I also learnt how to approach a project with the mobile first work flow. It was quite easy to work with


### Continued development

I'd love to continue using css grid to create responsive websites and also working with the mobile first approach. CSS grid is awesome!
